# Martingale-System
The usage of the Martingale System in betting, decided to try this method for fun and create a simulation. The code consist of simple loops, math, and some luck ;)

Just for fun and curiosity.

## Summary
The Martingale method entails doubling down on lost bets and halving winning wagers. It is simply a technique that develops a loss-averse mindset in order to maximize the possibilities of breaking even while also increasing the chances of severe and sudden losses.
