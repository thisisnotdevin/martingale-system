# Martingale-System
The usage of the *Martingale System* in betting, decided to try this method for fun and create a simulation. The code consist of simple loops, math, and some luck ;)

Just for fun and curiosity.

## Summary
*The Martingale method* entails doubling down on lost bets and halving winning wagers. It is simply a technique that develops a loss-averse mindset in order to maximize the possibilities of breaking even while also increasing the chances of severe and sudden losses.

## What causes the martingale to fail?
The difficulty with the martingale technique is that a single lost strike might wipe out your whole bankroll. Also adding the fact that it has a small chance it lands on green, limiting the factors that your chances won't be `50% / 50%`, assuming you're playing on the roulette.
